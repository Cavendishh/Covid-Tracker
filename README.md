<strong>Summary: </strong>
  This project was done by myself as a school project to dynamically make a Javascript web application while using good programming practices 
  and without any kind of framework or library (except jQuery). It is vital to know the fundamentals of Javascript because it reinforces 
  learning when moving into more further in the world of Javascript. Covid tracker fetches JSON data from three different APIs that are 
  fetched by using jQuery ajax functions. The tracker also has only very basic CSS (some of it added dynamically) because that was not 
  the focus of this project.
